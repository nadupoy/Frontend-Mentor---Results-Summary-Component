README.md NOTES:

1. Using a Personal Access Token to sign-in/verify an account on Github via Git on the Linux(WSL) terminal.

Discovered this upon encountering a 'fatal: Authentication failed for <git repository>' error.

I managed to find a solution here https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29193 that explains how Github uses PAT(Personal Access Token) instead of an account password when authenticating Git operations.


2. Icon `rel` attribute values that are mainly used to indicate special icon types for use on various mobile platforms. Came across this line of code in the `public/index.html` file that put this into use:
    `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />`

This was a good source that explained it: <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />

3. I encountered a problem where I was pushing code to Github via the Linux(WSL) terminal but it failed to reflect on the Github repository.

I realised I was not pushing code from the root directory `results-summary-component-main`.
Instead I was pushing from the sub-directory `results-summary-component-main/public` hence the pushed code failed to reflect in the Github repository.

LESSON LEARNT! ALWAYS WORK FROM THE ROOT DIRECTORY!!!


4. Self-hosting web fonts: https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/self_hosting_web_fonts


5. Encountered the following error:
    'SyntaxError: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>?'

From this (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adjacent-jsx-elements-must-be-wrapped-in-an-enclosing-tag/) article, I learnt that the render method can only take a single HTML element.
To fix the error, multiple HTML elements are embedded inside a single <div> element.


6. I learnt how to fetch & display data from a JSON file from this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgAwjP20RY)


7. Icon images could not initially load when they were in the same directory as App.js.

Fixed the issue by moving the icon image files to the public directory, as they would be referenced from the index.html file & not the App.js file.
